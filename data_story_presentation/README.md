## Presentation of your data story for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project

The presentation contains maps and dataframes to illustrate the presence of Little Caesars Pizza Locations in low-income communities. It is presented using a notebook, Final_Data_Story_Presentation_solanoa.ipynb, mostly markdown and a few code cells. My target audience is young people who like memes and like to think about the things that they consume, since I talk a bit about the implication of Little Caesars memes.
