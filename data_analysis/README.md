## Data analysis notebooks for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project

* This folder should contain the a series of Jupyter notebooks you create to do the data analysis.

* Update this README file to document the notebooks and give a short description of what each one does.

#### Philly_Grocery_Analysis.ipynb
* Preliminary analysis of Philadelphia dataset, looking for associations
#### littlecaesars_webscraping.ipynb
* Web scraping to find the addresses of the Little Caesars in Philadelphia and Chicago
#### chicago_grocery_analysis.ipynb
* Exploration of Chicago grocery dataset, looking for associations 
#### assignment6.ipynb
* Exploring 5 questions, heavily based on Chicago, looking at associations between number of grocery stores, type of store, income, police presence, and manufacturing in one area to draw conclusions about the data and  the presence of grocery  stores in  Chicago.
#### analysishere.ipynb
* Majority of exploration/analysis in this notebook, implementing mapping and merging data to see Little Caesars presence with income, showing all the different cities. I tried to implement Los Angeles in the data analysis but I could not find geodata that I could work with since I wanted to do mapping and Los Angeles County is such a big place and a place where I think income disparities are really prominent.
