## My final project for COMM318 _Stories from Data_ (Fall2020)


* How is poor food access correlated to the presence of Little Caesars in an area?

* In today's urban environments in the United States, cities are classified by good areas and bad areas, and to some extent this can carry out into the suburbs too. However, that distinction is very clearly made and then accepted, but there is obviously more nuance to that distinction. This project aims to explore that distinction and how different areas of cities and suburbs are classified while calling upon data on food access and the presence of Little Caesars
